# -Siraj-Challenge-_q_learning_demo

This is my entry to Siraj Raval's Q-Learning challenge. I modified this image:
http://vgmaps.com/Atlas/Wii/LegendOfZelda-TwilightPrincess-ForestTemple.png

and the World.py file so that the modified image could be turned into a simplified bird's eye view of the Forest Temple from
Legend of Zelda - Twilight Princess for the Q-Learning agent to explore. There are five types of blocks the agent can walk on:
ground, vines, water, poison and end, which give these rewards respectively: -4, -8, -12, -16 and 3000.

Unfortunately the agent as it currently is tends to get stuck somehow, so I not been able to get any proper experimental 
results from it except one simple observation: the score of the agent after it had reached the end for the first time was
greater when the discount was set to 0.6 than when it was set to 0.3.
